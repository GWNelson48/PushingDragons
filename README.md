If you read my main GitHub README file, this is the D&D show that I helped on.

If you didn't read my main GitHub README file then I helped on a live-action D&D show.
This is a very rough recap of as a simple up-scrolling shooter. I have a lot of changes I'd make with another project like this.

For starters, I think the way waves are spawned is limiting and there aren't many tutorials out that for more interesting shot patterns, also everything feels cramped, so maybe I'd use smaller sprites and/or a larger aspect ratio.
I'd change the bombs from being generic to specialized for each character, have better feedback on boss damage, have a scoring system that tallied up at the end of the stage...

Basically I'd make it more like Aero Fighters/Sonic Wings.
